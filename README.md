# Problem Statement

<em>The 'College Board' has had incomplete and inconsistent participation and performance on both the SAT and ACT exams. Low participation on exams means less revenue for the company and inconsistent participation rates makes it more challenging to properly allocate resources needed to plan for and administer the exams.</em>

## Executive Summary

Through thorough analysis of the SAT & ACT data as well as independent research, I have concluded that the most effective way to increase participation rate for the SAT is to lobby local governments for its mandate and funding.
